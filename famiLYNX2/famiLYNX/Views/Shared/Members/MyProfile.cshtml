<!-- This view will show the user their information as well as options
    for adding themselves to a family or creating a new family.  That
    will make them the administrator/creator of that family.  Do I even
    need someone to be the administrator?  I think the only thing I need
    a particular user to have control over is a conversation that is an 
    event.-->
